# Emozika Theatre Website
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

Emozika Theatre Website is a small, but fully–featured website for a real children’s theatre studio in Saint Petersburg. The goal of the project is to provide a clear and modern way for parents and visitors to learn about the theatre, see the current repertoire, explore photos and videos from performances, and buy tickets via the Yandex.Afisha widget. The site is designed as a single-page application that can later grow into a multi-page website with dedicated pages for each play when the repertoire expands.

From a technical point of view, the project is a data-driven front-end application built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. All plays and events are stored as structured data and rendered dynamically into the “Afisha” section, including automatic sorting by date and separation of upcoming and past performances. The site is fully responsive, includes an image and video gallery, a section for legal documents (license and local regulations), and integrates an external ticket widget from Yandex.Afisha. The main focus of the project is clean layout, modular JavaScript code, and an architecture that allows Emozika Theatre to extend the site in the future without rewriting it from scratch.
